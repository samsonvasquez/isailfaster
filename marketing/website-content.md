## About Page

### Our Story
iSailFaster was born from frustration. As competitive sailors ourselves, we were tired of fumbling with generic timer apps during crucial race starts. We needed something purpose-built for sailing - something that understood the unique demands of competitive racing.

After countless hours on the water and in the development lab, we created the first sailing timer that truly gets it. Voice announcements that cut through wind noise. GPS tracking that gives you the data you need. An interface designed for wet hands and bright sunlight.

### Our Mission
To give every sailor the tools they need to sail faster, start better, and race with confidence.

### The Team
**Founded by sailors, built for sailors**
Our team combines decades of sailing experience with cutting-edge mobile development expertise. We race everything from dinghies to offshore yachts, and we use our own app every time we hit the water.
